# Publish workflow

How emergence-lab keeps the public mirror clean, and how the site deploy
relates to the publish action. Read this before pushing anything to the
public remote.

## Model

This repo runs the **staged publish model** in `preserve` history
mode. There are three long-lived branches with different audiences:

- **`dev`** — integration/staging branch. Topic branches
  (`feat/*`, `wip/*`, …) fast-forward here first. Never deploys, never
  publishes; it is the buffer where work accumulates before it advances
  to `main`. Local and `origin` only. It may contain tracked private-tier
  files such as `HANDOFF.md`.
- **`main`** — site trunk. Private origin (`tw-one/emergence-lab`).
  Netlify deploys from this branch on every push. `dev` fast-forwards
  here via `git ff-dev-main`. It is private and may contain private-tier
  files as well as commits not yet visible on the public mirror.
- **`publish`** — curated public mirror trunk. Publish-safe commits are
  fast-forwarded here from a release branch based on `publish`, excluding
  private-tier files and commits. It is pushed to `public`
  (`aw-pr/emergence-lab`) as `main`, append-only and always publish-clean.

The site flow is `feat/* → dev → main`. The public flow is
`publish → release/* → publish → public`, cherry-picking the publish-safe
commits from the private line when necessary. Advancing `main` (via
`git ff-dev-main`) updates the site. Running `git publish` pushes an already
curated `publish` head. You choose when to do each. Both aliases require a
local `dev` branch to exist.

## The one hard invariant

Whatever commit `public/main` points at is immutable. Squash or rewrite
freely *above* it; never *at or below* it. Rewriting a published commit
would require a history-rewriting push to the public remote — treat that
as an incident, not routine.

## History mode

`publishguard.historymode = preserve`. Atomic commits with per-agent
authorship (see CLAUDE.md and `~/.claude/rules/mcp-hub-dev-rules.md`) land
on the public mirror as-is. The public history is the audit trail.

Squashing above `publish` is not part of routine publishing. Commits land on
the mirror atomically, commit-by-commit, via the release-branch cherry-pick
flow below — the per-agent commit trail is part of what the mirror
demonstrates. The only legitimate squash is the one-time seed when first
publishing a repo that has been private for a while; once seeded, do not
repeat it. (Historical note: the mirror was last caught up by a squashed
sync on 2026-08-13, commit `183974e`, under the older wording of this
section. Published commits are immutable, so it stays; it is not a
precedent.)

## Day-to-day

```bash
# Land a feature on the staging branch:
git switch dev
git merge --ff-only feat/whatever   # commits already have per-agent --author=
git push origin dev

# When dev is ready to deploy, advance main (this deploys the site):
git ff-dev-main               # ff main onto dev, push origin main -> Netlify

# Curate the public release without private-tier commits:
git switch -c release/<slug> publish
git cherry-pick <publish-safe-commit>...
git switch publish
git merge --ff-only release/<slug>
git publish                   # push origin publish, then public publish:main
git branch -d release/<slug>
```

The `git ff-dev-main` alias (advance the site):

1. Refuses if the working tree is dirty.
2. Fetches `origin` and resolves the default branch (`main`).
3. Requires a local `dev` branch to exist.
4. Switches to `main`, `pull --ff-only origin main`, then
   `merge --ff-only dev` (fails if `dev` is not a descendant of `main`).
5. Pushes `origin main` — **this is what triggers the Netlify deploy.**
6. Returns to the branch you started on.

The `git publish` alias (push the curated public mirror):

1. Refuses if the working tree is dirty.
2. Requires a local `dev` branch to exist (aborts otherwise).
3. Switches to `publish`.
4. Refuses if a configured private-tier file exists at the `publish` head.
5. Pushes `publish` to the private remote (`origin`, for backup).
6. Pushes `publish:main` to the public remote (`public`), with the
   `PUBLISH_GUARD_OK=1` sentinel the pre-push hook requires.
7. Returns to `dev` on exit.

Do **not** hand-type `git push public main` to publish. Route through
`git publish` so the backup push and the public push happen together.

The publish boundary is PR-by-default and the pre-push hook enforces it:
the push to `public/main` is rejected unless `PUBLISH_PR_REVIEWED=1` is
set, the attestation that a `publish → main` PR was opened and its diff
reviewed (private-tier paths absent). Sequence: `git push public publish`
(the hook allows the PR source, private-file-scanned), `gh pr create
--base main --head publish`, review the diff, then
`PUBLISH_PR_REVIEWED=1 git publish` — the fast-forward push completes the
PR, which GitHub marks merged once the base holds the head commits.
Repo-level opt-out: `git config publishguard.boundary direct`.

## What never goes public

- Tracked private-tier files: `HANDOFF.md`, `RUNBOOK.md`, `runs/`, and
  `archive/`. They remain portable on private branches and are excluded from
  the curated `publish` history.
- Topic branches (`wip/*`, `tuning-and-visual-fixes`, etc.) — these are
  for `origin` only. The pre-push hook on `public` rejects anything other
  than the `main` ref.
- Agent runtime state branches (`phat-controller/state`) — local only.
- `.publish-guard.local`, `.env*`, the autometta `state/` directory, and
  anything matching the personal patterns. The pre-commit hook enforces
  this at staging time.

## Guard infrastructure

Source-of-truth files in the repo:

- `scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit` — refuses to stage files matching
  sensitive paths and diff content matching `GUARD_PATTERNS`.
- `scripts/git-hooks/pre-push` — on the public remote (matched by
  `GUARD_PUBLIC_URL_MATCH`), allows only the branch named in
  `GUARD_PUBLIC_BRANCH` (set to `main` — the public-side branch name,
  which is what `publish:main` resolves to). Other remotes are
  unrestricted.
- `scripts/install-guards.sh` — idempotent installer. Copies both hooks
  into `.git/hooks/` and seeds `.publish-guard.local` from the example.
- `.publish-guard.local.example` — committed template with placeholders.
  Real values go into `.publish-guard.local` which is gitignored.

Override once for a deliberate exception: `git commit --no-verify` or
`git push --no-verify`. Both are escape hatches; they should not appear in
routine workflows.

## Config keys

Local git config (not committed), set once at adoption:

```sh
git config publishguard.publicmatch    aw-pr/emergence-lab
git config publishguard.publicremote   public
git config publishguard.publishbranch  publish
git config publishguard.privateremote  origin
git config publishguard.historymode    preserve
```

And `.publish-guard.local` carries the personal-pattern allow-list and
matches the public remote URL fragment.

## One-time setup on a fresh clone

```sh
bash scripts/install-guards.sh
```

That copies the hooks and seeds a placeholder `.publish-guard.local`.
Then edit `.publish-guard.local` and replace the placeholders with the
real values:

```sh
GUARD_PATTERNS='<MAC_HOME_PATH>|<LINUX_HOME_PATH>|<OP_REF_SCHEME>|<USERNAME>@|<EMAIL>'
GUARD_PUBLIC_URL_MATCH='aw-pr/emergence-lab'
GUARD_PUBLIC_BRANCH='main'
```

Set the five `publishguard.*` config keys above. Add the public remote
and create the local `dev` and `publish` branches (both aliases require
`dev` to exist):

```sh
git remote add public git@github.com:aw-pr/emergence-lab.git
git fetch public
git branch publish public/main
git branch dev main            # or: git switch -c dev
```

Re-create the `git ff-dev-main` and `git publish` aliases if they're not
in your git config (they're set locally per-checkout in this repo).

## Audit before any public push

1. `git status` clean.
2. `npm run verify` green.
3. The `repo-publish-audit` skill returns only documentation false
   positives (this file, `.cursor/rules/publish-safety.mdc`).
4. `git ls-files | grep -E '\.env$|settings\.local|op-refs\.local\.sh$|/auth\.json$|\.log$'`
   is empty.
5. Bundle backup taken:
   `git bundle create ~/emergence-lab-history-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).bundle --all`.

Then fast-forward the audited release branch onto `publish` and run
`git publish`.

## Site deploy and publish are independent

- **Site update without publish**: land work on `dev`, then
  `git ff-dev-main` (advances `main`, pushes `origin main`). Netlify
  rebuilds. `publish` does not move; the public mirror is unchanged.
- **Publish without site update**: not really meaningful in this repo —
  the public mirror should only contain work already deployed from private
  `main`, so it lags or reflects the deployed site and never leads it.
- **Both**: ordinary case. Push to `main` (site updates), then
  curate `publish` and run `git publish` when ready (public mirror catches up).
