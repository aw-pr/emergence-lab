## The nineteen

Nineteen deterministic kernels behind one renderer. Each is a different
discipline's way of pointing at the same thing: local rules, global form.

- **Gray-Scott** reaction diffusion. Chemistry's version of the question.
- **Abelian sandpile.** Self-organised criticality in one toy.
- **2D Ising model.** A magnetic lattice assembling order at a phase transition.
- **Kuramoto oscillators.** Different rhythms crossing into collective synchrony.
- **Conway's Game of Life.** The original, and still the cleanest.
- **Belousov-Zhabotinsky** waves. The reaction that taught chemistry about excitable media.
- **Boids.** Flocking from three local rules.
- **Particle life.** A handful of attraction rules, and cells assemble themselves.
- **Physarum.** Slime-mould agents laying pheromone trails into networks.
- **Strange attractors** (Lorenz, Rössler, Thomas, Aizawa, Halvorsen — five separate cards). Where deterministic equations stop being predictable.
- **Diffusion-limited aggregation.** How dendrites and lightning agree.
- **Elementary cellular automata.** Wolfram's one-dimensional zoo.
- **Brian's Brain.** Three states. Somehow it breathes.
- **Cyclic cellular automata.** Rock-paper-scissors that spirals into itself.
- **Lenia.** Continuous cellular automata, and life gets smooth gliders.
- **Mandelbrot, Julia, Burning Ship.** Iterated maps as the geometry of feedback.
- **Logistic Mandelbrot.** The bifurcation cascade hung off the Mandelbrot set as a curtain.

Gray-Scott is the priority kernel. The others are calibrated and held.

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the URL Vite prints, normally `http://localhost:5173/`.

Checks:

```bash
npm run verify   # types, kernel tests, production build
npm test
npm run build
```

## Publish into the site

The lab's own standalone deploy serves from the root path (`/`) and is
unaffected by the steps below. To vendor a build into a host site instead, at
`/labs/app/`:

```bash
npm run publish:site
```

This publishes four artifacts (`scripts/publish-site.sh`), each rsynced with
`-a --delete` so stale files from a previous build are removed:

- `dist/` → `public/labs/app/` — the static app (Vite base `/labs/app/`),
  standalone and fullscreen target
- `dist-lib/` → `public/labs/lib/` — the library build (`vite.lib.config.ts`,
  entry `src/app/lib.ts`): the `<emergence-lab-sim>` web component plus
  `mountLab`, which the site's /labs/run shell imports by URL and mounts inline
- KaTeX css + fonts → `public/labs/app/katex/` — stable unhashed path the web
  component links into its shadow root (class rules) and the host document
  (font faces)
- registry manifest → `src/vendor/emergence-lab/registry.json` — lets the
  site's build fail on slug drift instead of shipping dead deep links

The promo-flow path defaults to a sibling checkout; override it with
`PROMO_FLOW_DIR` if promo-flow lives elsewhere:

```bash
PROMO_FLOW_DIR=/path/to/promo-flow npm run publish:site
```

Nothing is committed or pushed on the promo-flow side; that repository
commits its own copy of the vendored build.

## Baking a local point cloud

The logistic-Mandelbrot orbit3d view builds its point cloud in the browser,
time-sliced and capped so it stays responsive on whatever device it lands on.
That ceiling is the honest one for the web: the deployed app cannot assume a
desktop GPU, and a cloud dense enough to resolve the cascade tail runs to
hundreds of megabytes — the current machine-local bakes are 10 MB to 650 MB.
Nobody should be asked to download that over a network, so it never ships.

The active route is exposed on the simulation canvas as
`data-orbit3d-sampler` (the DOM form of `canvas.dataset.orbit3dSampler`):

| Path | When selected | `data-orbit3d-sampler` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GPU sampled | WebGL2 float targets and the orbit sampler both complete | `gpu-sampled` |
| CPU sampled | GPU sampling is unavailable or fails; the time-sliced sweep completes | `cpu-sampled-gpu-failed` |
| Prebaked ELPC | A valid requested local bake finishes loading and supersedes the live build | `prebaked` |
| 2D field | orbit3d setup or both live cloud builders fail | `orbit3d-fallback-field` |

For a 3D cloud, `data-orbit3d-build="complete"` and a positive
`data-orbit3d-points` confirm that the selected path produced a whole cloud.
The 2D fallback intentionally has neither attribute.

Instead the cloud can be baked offline, on the machine that will view it, with
no time-slicing, a much higher warmup, and a second refinement level the
browser can't afford:

```bash
npm run build:test                  # the baker reuses the compiled kernel
node scripts/bake-orbit3d.mjs --points 50e6 --warmup 30000 --out public/baked/lm-50M.elpc
```

Flags: `--points` (target total), `--samples` (orbit window per cell,
default 64), `--warmup` (default 20000), `--refine-fraction` (default 0.35),
`--out` (default `public/baked/logistic-mandelbrot.elpc`).

Total points ≈ cells × samples, so at a fixed `--points` budget raising
`--samples` buys vertical density in the attractor at the cost of resolution in
the *c* plane. Periodic cells only have *p* distinct heights however many
samples are taken; the chaotic bands are where extra samples show.

Each run writes the quantized `.elpc` binary and merges an entry into
`public/baked/index.json`. The app fetches that manifest at mount and turns it
into the **Model source** dropdown in the View controls — `live` plus one
option per bake. With no manifest the control is not rendered at all, and the
fetch is skipped outright unless the page is served from a local host, so the
published site never asks for a file that cannot exist there.

`public/baked/` is git-ignored and excluded from the publish rsync
(`scripts/publish-site.sh`), so bakes stay on the machine that made them.

## Stack

Vite and TypeScript throughout. Kernels are pure deterministic numerics
with no runtime dependencies. The renderer uses a quality-first WebGL2/GPU
path, including direct fragment-shader fractals, with Canvas 2D kept as a
fallback and debug surface.
Legacy browsers are not a target.

## Adding a simulation

1. Extend the `SimKernel` contract in [`docs/INTERFACE.md`](docs/INTERFACE.md) if the new sim needs it.
2. Add the kernel under `src/sims/<name>/` and wire the gallery in `src/app/**`.
3. Write the essay in `essays/<name>.md`.

There is no fixed split of the codebase by model — any agent may work any  
part of it. Multi-agent work runs through autometta (a worker/verifier loop)  
when parallel work and cross-checking are wanted. The kernel contract in  
[`docs/INTERFACE.md`](docs/INTERFACE.md) stays a reviewed boundary. See  
[`MODELS.md`](MODELS.md).
